# Elida Rangel's Intermediate Programming Class Profilio:

## Assignments:
1. Bee Movie Website
2. Life Hack Generator Bot
3. Dog API Test
4. Java Cheat Sheet
5. Final Alien API

### Bee Movie Website:
I've been familar with working with HTML and CSS before this class, but learning it formally helped me understand the logic behind it so that I can better understand not only my HTML and CSS code, but also other HTML and CSS code that other people have written. The site is fairly simple, only having one main body of text and several buttons to change the font size. The assignment was to create something unexpected for the user, and I decided to make it subtle. While the buttons claim to change the font size to be smaller or bigger, it does the exact opposite of what it claims to do. I decided to choose the Bee Movie theme for fun, and made the site background myself in Photoshop, also for fun.
